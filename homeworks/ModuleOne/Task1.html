            <p><strong>PROLOGUE</strong></p>
            <p>
                Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
                From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
                From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
                Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
                The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
                Which, but their children's end, nought could remove, Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
                The which if you with patient ears attend, What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
